My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be | Until you all shared its magic with me
Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness
Friendship is Magic
Friendship is Magic
Friendship is Magic
Do you know you're all my very best friends?
Do you know you're all my very best friends?
Do you know you're all my very best friends?
WINTER WRAP UP! WINTER WRAP UP!!
The Magic of Friendship Grows
When I started out, I was unsure
This is where the magic happens
Our friendships weave together stronger
The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer
And the greatest spell you'll know | Is how the Magic of Friendship grows
And no matter how much time goes by | The party will still be here with some fun new games to try
Long as we're still here together | We'll be flying happily
The elements of harmony
We're not flawless | We're a work in progress
Heads high, ponies! Marching proud!
All together now! Every one of you! No pony left behind!
Life is a smile in Our Town
Winning only breeds the worst | Ego-filled conceit
You can't have a nightmare | If you never dream
My name is Pinkie Pie
I'm gonna make you smile and I will brighten up your day
'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile
I'll work real hard and do my best to turn that sad frown upside down
Come on everypony smile, smile, smile
To crush our enemies to death and laugh as they all scream
You think you've got problems? I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am!
yay.
P U D D I N G!
I think I see a better way to be bad!
I didn't wanna believe you cursed us. But the evidence is overwhelming.
You made me look ridiculous
Laughs don't come in barrels. They come from inside you as your body's response to delight.
He's my shmoopy-doopy sweedy-weedy pony pie
Eeyup.
I just don't know what went wrong!
Just make it 20% cooler
Dear Princess Celestia,
I didn't learn a thing. I was right all along
Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING.
Uhm... I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle.
